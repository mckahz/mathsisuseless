# First Principles

The derivative is best visualised on a graph.
Say we have a car travelling at 100 km/h.
We can graph said car's position over time like so:

{INSERT GRAPH HERE}

If we think about what the car's speed is, it's the change of position, or rise of our graph, divided by the run of our graph.

But there's a glaring issue with that. If our car travelled like this:

{INSERT ANIMATION HERE}

What is the speed of the car? Obviously it changes, so we need some way of finding the speed at some point in time.
We do this by selecting that point in time and getting the rise over run at that point.
A quick check should make this feel correct, the speed of our car starts at 0, just as the slope does, then slowly increases.

There is no rise over run over a single *point*, since there's no run, that's rise/0.
So instead we find the rise over run of our point in time, and at a point after an infinitely small step in time.
