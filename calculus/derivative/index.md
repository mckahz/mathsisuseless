# Derivative

The derivative of a function is the way that function changes compared to something else. 
Usually how something like position changes over time.
Examples of derivatives are velocity, which is how position changes over time. Or acceleration, which is how velocity changes over time.

This idea is ubiquitous in mathematics and physics and can be generalized to encapsulate slopes of graphs (which is how they are quite often visualised),
