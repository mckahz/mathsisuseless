# Speed to Distance

Let's say we know a car's speed at any given point in time, and we want to know how far it has travelled.
If for our whole journey, we were travelling at 50km/h, and we travelled for 5 hours, we would know that we travelled
\\[\frac{50\text{km}}{\text{hour}}\times5\text{hours}}=250\text{km} \\]
But what if our speed was changing over time? Then it gets harder.

Let's assume our car's speed \\(s\\) is given by \\(s = t\\). That is at \\(t=1, s=1\\) and at \\(t=5, s=5\\), so on.
This question is hard. Think about it for a bit, it's worth appreciating how difficult this question really is.
