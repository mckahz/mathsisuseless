# Kinematics In Calculus

This set of tutorials will teach calculus through motion. We'll look at position, speed, and acceleration and see if we can generalise them.
Through generalisations of these concepts, we'll invent the central concepts of calculus, then we'll expand these ideas to apply to any rate of change.
