# Calculus

Loosely speaking, calculus is the study of infinity. As Steven Strogatz puts it in his "Infinite Powers", calculus is applications of the infinite principle, disassembling hard problems into infinitely many easy problems, solving them then putting them back together.

There will be 2 sets of tutorials, which will be more or less the same. The first set will be using distance and speed, as I believe it's an intuitive way to introduce the notion. The second will be the same content, but more abstracted for general use.

I've made a few choices in the following articles, explained below, which are irrelevant if you are just learning calculus. Skip them if you're just here to learn. Nevertheless I have explained them for those who have already learnt calculus wondering why I made such bizarre choices.

I will give a non-graphical intuition for the derivative here for 2 reasons:
1. There already exists plenty of good graphical intutions out there, see [#Blue1Brown's Essence of Calculus](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr).
2. The derivative isn't all about slopes, it's all about rates of change. While slopes are a good way to introduce and visualise the derivative, it doesn't expand very far into the study of calculus.

There will be a few layman's terms used in these lessons:
1. I will also be using kilometers and hours instead of meters and seconds to cause less friction with those learning the derivative. People comfortable with m/s have likely already taken a calculus course.
2. I use speed and distance instead of the usual velocity and displacement. This is a more substantive change, since it technically makes everything taught here *wrong*, but I chose to use these words because laymen think in these terms. The nuance between the 2 isn't important for grasping the ideas of calculus, so for a less frictionless uptake, I think it's worth the correction later down the line of introducing the difference between scalars and vectors.
