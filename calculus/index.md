# Calculus

Loosely speaking, calculus is the study of infinity. As Steven Strogatz puts it in his "Infinite Powers", calculus is applications of the infinite principle, disassembling hard problems into infinitely many easy problems, solving them then putting them back together.

There will be 2 sets of tutorials, which will be more or less the same. The first set will be using distance and speed, as I believe it's an intuitive way to introduce the notion. The second will be the same content, but more abstracted for general use.

I will give a non-graphical intuition for the derivative here for 2 reasons:
1. There already exists plenty of good graphical intutions out there, see [#Blue1Brown's Essence of Calculus](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr).
2. The derivative isn't all about slopes, it's all about rates of change. While slopes are a good way to introduce and visualise the derivative, it doesn't expand very far into the study of calculus.

I will also be using kilometers and hours instead of meters and seconds to cause less friction with those learning the derivative. People comfortable with m/s have likely already taken a calculus course.
