# Exact Speed

Let's say we want to know the speed of our car from the last section, after 3 hours. That is, at //(t=3//).
The key insight here, is that the speed of the car after 3 hours, must be more than the average speed thus far.
Likewise, the speed of the car after 3 hours is *less* than the average speed over the *next* 3 hours.
We know the average speed for the first 3 hours is the distance travelled (//(9km//)) over the time taken, 3 hours,
or //[\frac{9km}{3h}=3km/h //]
So the speed at //(t=3//) hours must be more than 3km/h.
Likewise, from //(t=3//) to //(t=6//), the speed is the distance travelled //(6^2-3^2=36-9=27//) over the time taken, 3 hours,
or //[\frac{27km}{3h}=9km/h //]
This hasn't helped us too much. We now know the speed at 3 hours must be somewhere between 3 and 9 km/h.
Here's the clever part: the speed at 3 hours must be greater than the average speed over any point in time
