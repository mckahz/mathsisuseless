# Double Angle Theorem (CT1)

\[\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}\]

CT1, or the double angle theorem as I'll be calling it, is the foundation for half the rest of the circle theorems. The theorem states that a shape like this:

That is, drawn on the inside of a circle where \\(C\\) is the center, the blue angle is twice the red angle.
This is pretty easy to prove, too:
Lets first label them, because symbols are nice.

Draw a line from the center to the smaller angle.
The 2 inner angles we'll call \\(\alpha\\) and \\(\beta\\).
Now we have 2 triangles, and since two side lengths of each triangle are radii of the circle, the 2 opposite angles must be the same.
I'm gonna quickly add more labels, but don't worry! We won't use them long!
This gives us that \\(2\alpha + x = 180\\) and \\(2\beta + y = 180\\). We can add these 2 equations together to get 
\\((2\alpha + x) + (2\beta + y) = 180 + 180\\)
\\(2\alpha + x + 2\beta + y = 360\\)
\\(2\alpha + 2\beta + x + y = 360\\)
\\(2(\alpha + \beta) + x + y = 360\\)
We also know that \\(x + y + \phi = 360\\), since that forms one full revolution. So we can determine that
\\(2(\alpha + \beta) + x + y = 360 = x + y + \phi\\)
\\(2(\alpha + \beta) + x + y = x + y + \phi\\)
\\(2(\alpha + \beta) = \phi\\)
But \\(\alpha + \beta\\) is our original angle, \\(\theta\\)! So \\(2\theta = \phi\\)!
Solved!
