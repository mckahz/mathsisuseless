# Multiplicative Law

Lets say we have $$(a^2)^3$$. That is,

$$(a^2)^3 = a^2\times a^2\times a^2$$

Which we can view two ways, either as

$$
\begin{aligned}
(a^2)^3 &= a^2\times a^2\times a^2 \\
&= (a\times a)\times (a\times a)\times (a\times a)
\end{aligned}
$$

Which means we have 3 lots of 2 $$a$$'s being multiplied together, or $$3\times 2=6$$ many $$a$$'s.

The other way to look at it, is using the addition law,

$$
\begin{aligned}
(a^2)^3 &= a^2\times a^2\times a^2 \\
&= a^{2+2+2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Either way, we have that $$(a^2)^3 = a^{3\times 2} = a^6$$.

The same argument works for any set of numbers,

$$
\begin{aligned}
(a^n)^m = \underbrace{a^n \times \cdots \times a^n}_{m \times} \\
&= a^{m\times n}
\end{aligned}
$$

Which is the multiplicative law, $$(a^n)^m = a^{mn}$$.
