# Indicies

Indicies, are a shorthand way to write repeated multiplication, just like multiplication is a shorthand way to write repeated addition.
For eaample,

$$3\times3\times3\times3 = 3^4$$

Because the left hand side is 3 *times* itself 4 times, so we write $$3^4$$. So for any value $$a$$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
a^1 &= a
a^2 &= a\times a \\
a^3 &= a\times a\times a \\
a^4 &= a\times a\times a\times a \\
\end{aligned}
$$

And in general,

$$a^n = \underbrace{a\times...\times a}_{n\text{ times}}$$

I will use the word "exponents" interchangeably with "indicies", but they mean the same thing.
