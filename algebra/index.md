# Algebra

I remember taking a quiz in year 8 and not knowing the answer to a simple question. "What is the product of 4 and 8?"
What is a product? At the time it was out of nowhere, I'd never heard this term before. So after I lost a mark for not getting that question,
I asked my teacher what the product was. "Oh, it means multiply. The product of 4 and 8 is $$4\times 8$$"
and I was confused and annoyed. Why didn't they just say "Solve $$4\times 8$$, not only is that easier to write, but it's more consise.
It doesn't need to reference the vague idea of a "product".

For thousands of years, up until the invention of algebra, this is just how maths was done. Pythagoras' Theorem was originally stated as

"The sum of the shorter two sides of a right angle triangle is equal to the sum of the remaining side"

Wow, $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ is much easier to say. This is an elementary school idea, but expressing it with words is still a bit overwhelming, even to me. So overwhelming that strawman got almost every part of it wrong!

Algebra is a beautiful way which we simplify concepts. It allows us to cram a bunch of information into small expressions, and use conceptual shorthands for anything.
In a sense, it's the language of maths. There are few ideas in maths which are not expressed easier with algebra.
Even though this is the case, people *hate* algebra, but it should be your friend, not your enemy. Complex looking equations like

$$i\hbar \dfrac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -\dfrac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\Psi + V\Psi$$

Might seem overwhelming, but they would be a hell of a lot worse without the symbols.

The articles I have written will contain minimal algebra, but as you will notice, it's almost impossible to pry myself away from it.
Algebra makes evverything so much easier, so it's worth learning.
