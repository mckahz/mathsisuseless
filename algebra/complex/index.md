# Complex Numbers

Let me as you a question: What is the square root of $-1$?

If you've never encountered complex numbers before, this may seem like an obtuse question.
We know that the square of a negative is positive, and the square of a positive is a positive, so there's no way we can square a number and get a negative!
But let me ask you this- what is $\sqrt{-1}^2$? It's -1, right?
How about $\sqrt{(-1)^2}$? Well this one's easy, it's $\sqrt{(-1)^2} = \sqrt{1} = 1$.
But there's always a positive *and* negative solution to square roots, so it seems just as accurate to say that it's -1.
$\sqrt{-1}$ definitely has a value, and a value which we can maniulate at that. I'm just not sure what it is.
Let's just say there's some number $i$, which when squared we get $i^2 = -1$, and see what we can do with it.

The name $i$ comes from "impossible", because when people discovered it, they thought it was as absurd as you likely do!
But why are we still teaching it?
One reason is for completeness. 
Gauss came up with a little something called "The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra". If we didn't let $i$ exist, there would be a lot of caviats to that theorem, and it wouldn't be very nice.
