# Additive Law

I'm just gonna let the maths speak for itself here

$$
\begin{aligned}
a &= x^{\log_x(a)} \\
b &= x^{\log_x(b)} \\
ab &= x^{\log_x(ab)} \\
ab &= ab \\
x^{\log_x(ab)} &= x^{\log_x(a)}x^{\log_x(b)} \\
x^{\log_x(ab)} &= x^{\log_x(a) + \log_x(b)} \\
\implies \log_x(ab) &= \log_x(a) + \log_x(b)
\end{aligned}
$$

And that's the additive log law, for any base of our logarithm $$x$$

$$\log_x(ab) &= \log_x(a) + \log_x(b)$$

An intuitive way to imagine this is with multiples of 10:

$$\log_10(100,000) = 5 = 3+2 = \log_10(1,000) + \log_10(100)$$
