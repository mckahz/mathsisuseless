# Logarithms

If you understand indicies, then you already understand logarithms. The issue with logarithms is they suck and have bad notation, often confusing people as to what's going on.
If I showed you the equation $$3^x = 9$$ then asked you what $$x$$ was, if you understand indices it's obviously 2.
Whereas if I asked you "What is $$\log_3(9)$$", even if you understand *logarithms* this might still make you think twice.
The point is, these two questions are the exact same. $$\log_3(9) = 2$$.

In general, $$\log_a(b)$$ means "$$a$$ to the *what* equals $$b$$?" And this isn't a difficult question to answer

|Question|Logarithm Form|Answer|Because|
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 to the what equals 8? | $$\log_2(8)$$ | 3 | $$2^3=8$$ |
| 4 to the what equals 16? | $$\log_4(16)$$ | 2 | $$4^2=16$$ |
| 10 to the what equals 10000? | $$\log_10(10000)$$ | 4 | $$10^4=10000$$ |
| 2 to the what equals 2048? | $$\log_2(2048)$$ | 11 | 2^{11}=2048 |
| $$\cdots$$ | $$\cdots$$ | $$\cdots$$ | $$\cdots$$ |

This chapter will be quite algebra heavy. This is because I don't really think there is a good, intuitive way to understand logarithms, but at least seeing the proofs lets you know that these laws don't just come out of thin air.
