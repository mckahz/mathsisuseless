# Philosophy

This isn't actual philosophy, moreso the philosophy surrounding mathematics.
Quite often learning maths involves philosophical reasoning to be able to accept someone, like in complex numbers, groups, categories, calculus etc.
All of these studies have situations which make you cock your head and recoil saying stuff like "but we can't just do that!".
This section of the website is to address some of these concerns in a semi-philosophical way.
