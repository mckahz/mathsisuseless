# Reading vs Watching

There is definitely a huge benefit to watching a tutorial vs reading a tutorial.
When watching a tutorial, you get a very controlled, spoon fed and visualised lesson.
The issue with watching a tutorial becomes very obvious when you see people say things like ["pause and ponder"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw).
If you're anything like me, it's really easy to just do nothing and let the video keep playing, ignoring that advise completely.
This issue becomes apparent to me when I revisit these tutorials a couple years later and realise "Wow! I remember none of this!"

Stopping the video and digesting what you've learnt certainly would go a long way to prevent this forgetfulness, but as I just said: it's too easy to just *not* do that.
This is why I prefer to consume (and create) tutorials which you can *only* read.
The reason for this is 3 fold
1. If you want to pause and reflect on what you've learned, it's easier to do that than to keep reading the tutorial. It necessitates you to engage with the content rather than just skip over the stuff which just "seems legitimate". Especially if, (like me) you're a slow reader.
2. You can go at your own pace. If the video goes to quickly or too slowly, you can skip through it at the risk of missing something important, or you have to go back and rewatch something until it makes sense. When you're reading however, you're not punished quite as viciously. If something takes me some time to understand, or it's too boring and I don't want to sit through it, I simply read slower or faster, rather than instantaneously switching between video speeds.
3. A video is much harder to enjoy when one aspect of the production quality is lacking. If the video's audio is bad, camera angles are bad, there's a light shining on the whiteboard which makes it harder to see, the layout of what they're drawing is bad so you have to constantly dart back and forth to understand the flow of logic, or anything else cumbersome like that, then the video is less enjoyable. Luckily, there's some channels who's production quality is [phenominally good](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA), but it's not worth limiting what you can learn to these channels. There's a lot more knowledge out there than what talented channels can communicate to you.

This is less of a specific case of "you should adopt this philosophy" than the rest of the pages in this section, and more of a "this is what motivated me to make this website" ordeal.
If this inspires you to start teaching without the roadblocks of "I need a good camera" or "I need to learn how to edit videos" etc, then that's fantastic!
I'd love to see more content like what I'm making here. 
Just use Github pages with a theme you like (I'm using [Just the Docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) btw) and start writing.
It shouldn't take more than a couple of hours to establish your platform, then as short or as long as it takes to make everything else.
If you do this (or anything like this!), I'd love to see what you can put together!
