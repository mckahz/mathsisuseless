# Let Me Explain...

I quite often say that mathematics is a language, and I think this is a quaint idea.
We have these ideas which (using conventional language) are difficult to describe.
For example, if I said to you "The change in the change in distance for some infinitesmal step in time" your head will spin.
But luckily, we can use mathematics to encapsulate this idea quite simply, and more precisely.
I can instead just say to you "the second derivative of displacement with respects to time", or simply acceleration.
We've shrunk this incredibly complex idea into a word which we all understand: it's the force you feel in a car.
If you're first learning what exactly acceleration is, me telling you it's
$$\frac{\partial^2 x}{\partial t^2}$$
wouldn't really do you any favours.

However, when you understand the idea, it's a really nice quick-hand way to use and manipulate it in equations and more complex scenarios.
In this regard, it's very useful to be able to understand ideas mathematically. I could explain what this means
$$\forall \varepsilon > 0 \exists \delta > 0 [\forall x, |x - c| < \delta \implies |f(x) - f(c)| < L>>]$$
*or*, if you understand what each of those symbols mean, you can understand it quite easily.

This is a big reason why I so often call mathematics a language.
Imagine I said something to you in french, and you couldn't understand what it meant, so rather than learning the syntax of the language and what each word is, you get someone to translate it for you.
You'd be useless in Paris! You might as well not learn the language at all!
So be wary when someone explains complex ideas in a reductionist way which abandons all mathematical syntax.
While this has it's place, you're not gonna get good at a language until you actually learn the language.
