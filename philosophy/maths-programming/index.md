# Maths in Programming

Suppose you're a programmer and you avoid mathematics like the plague. 
Even though I am such a mathematics enthusiast, I empathise with this. 
School makes you hate maths, and university almost makes *me* hate maths.
Regardless, I still disagree with you, and I'll explain why.

Engage me in a thought experiment, if you will.
Imagine I came to you and said "I don't wanna learn what a vector is! I just want to program a game!".
You'd think I was being mad, especially if you've developed a rendering engine before.
Linear algebra (and hence vectors) is absolutely necessary to do that.
Vectors describe and help with so many things, representing characters' positions, calculating distances, calculating trajectories, the list goes on.
Even programming a versitile handle for a 3D game took a rudementry linear algebra course for me to be able to do.

Perhaps even more obtusely, imagine if I said "I don't want to know what algebra is! I just want to program!".
You wouldn't think I'm mad- you'd think I had never programmed before. 
Sure, you could do straight arithmatic with numbers and create a program, but it would be easier to swallow thumbtacks.
Algebra makes things way easier.

Now image a world where every programmer, at some point or another, programs in Haskell.
I think it's likely they'd give me some weird looks if waltzed up to them and said "I don't want to learn Category Theory! I just want to program!"?
Like all of the other examples, Category Theory has plenty of applications in functional programming.
They would know all the benefits of it, and look at me and think "dude, just learn what a monad is. It helps do so many things:
- Seperate pure functions from impure functions
- Write imperitivly with immutability
- Compose two functions even when their type signatures don't match
The list goes on."

This isn't to say you should study mathematics extensively to write good code, or even that you *need* it to understand what you're doing. You shouldn't, and you don't.
But I'm sure there's a big overlap with programmers who avoid mathematics, and people who'd show up to maths class and ask "when will we need this?".
And I wonder if they would have embraced mathematics more if the teacher turned around and said "when you learn to talk to a computer".
