# Category Theory

Category theory is to sets what relativity is to newtonian mechanics.
Relativity shifts the focus from entities to focusing on the relationship between entities. Likewise, category theory shifts from focusing about elements, to focusing on the relationship between objects.

Most of what I will say in this will be parroted from [Bartosz Milewski's lectures on category theory.](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_) A large portion of this will be a transcript of his lectures, because I believe it's a better format for self learning.
