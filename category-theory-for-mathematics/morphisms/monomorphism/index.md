# Monomorphisms

A monomorphism is a one-to-one (mono) morphism. A monomorphism is a one-to-one function, or injective function. But in category theory we like to use flashy language. The usual statement is:

A function $f: A \to B$ is injective if

$$\forall x, y \in A x\neq y \implies f(x) \neq f(y)$$

meaning that two values, $x$ and $y$ cannot map to the same element under $f$.
