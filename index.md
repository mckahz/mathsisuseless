# Welcome to Maths Is Useless

I believe maths should be enjoyed for the sake of enjoying it, like someone can enjoy music for the sake of it.
When exploring mathematics, however, it's quite easy to stumble across some road blocks.
You might come across an unfamiliar term, and finding what said term means can be like finding a needle in a haystack.
I've spent countless hours scouring wikipedia articles to understand what things are, to be barraded with conviluted, unmotivated definitions.
I might find myself reading a 30 page article bloated with uneeded ideas which have nothing to do with the idea I want to understand.

The whole point of this millenia old study is to more easily communicate the ideas underneath, it shouldn't be as prohibitive and confusing as many would believe it to be.
To demonstrate this, every article on this website will be no more than a page long, to demonstrate the underlying simplicity of these ideas.
