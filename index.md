# Welcome to Re-Equation

I'm sick of bad maths education resources. I'm making my own.

Things written on this website aim to be as simple as possible, as short as possible, and as easy to understand as possible. I will use as little jargon as I can without being reductive. I will cover topics I find interesting in the moment.

There is no resource that will perfectly teach everybody, but my hope is that this will come damn close.
